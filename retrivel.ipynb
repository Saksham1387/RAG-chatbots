Dr. Miller suggested joining a support group for people who stutter. I’m considering it, but the thought of speaking about my stutter to others who also struggle with it feels daunting.

I read aloud from my favorite book, “Harry Potter.” There were still moments when I got stuck on words, but I kept pushing through. I want to believe that with enough practice, I can improve.
